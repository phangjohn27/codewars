This was taken off of codewars that I have completed. The goal was to find all uppercases letter in an Array and then return the value of their indexes.

Instructions

Write a function that takes a single string (word) as argument. The function must return an ordered list containing the indexes of all capital letters in the string.

Example

Test.assertSimilar( capitals('CodEWaRs'), [0,3,4,6] );

It covers all cases as well as edge cases too.# practice_from_codewars




Take a 10min walk

You live in the city of Cartesia where all roads are laid out in a perfect grid. You arrived ten minutes too early to an appointment, so you decided to take the opportunity to go for a short walk. The city provides its citizens with a Walk Generating App on their phones -- everytime you press the button it sends you an array of one-letter strings representing directions to walk (eg. ['n', 's', 'w', 'e']). You always walk only a single block in a direction and you know it takes you one minute to traverse one city block, so create a function that will return true if the walk the app gives you will take you exactly ten minutes (you don't want to be early or late!) and will, of course, return you to your starting point. Return false otherwise.

    Note: you will always receive a valid array containing a random assortment of direction letters ('n', 's', 'e', or 'w' only). It will never give you an empty array (that's not a walk, that's standing still!).

//some test cases for you...
Test.expect(isValidWalk(['n','s','n','s','n','s','n','s','n','s']), 'should return true');
Test.expect(!isValidWalk(['w','e','w','e','w','e','w','e','w','e','w','e']), 'should return false');
Test.expect(!isValidWalk(['w']), 'should return false');
Test.expect(!isValidWalk(['n','n','n','s','n','s','n','s','n','s']), 'should return false');





3) CATEGORIZE NEW NUMBERS

The Western Suburbs Croquet Club has two categories of membership, Senior and Open. They would like your help with an application form that will tell prospective members which category they will be placed.

To be a senior, a member must be at least 55 years old and have a handicap greater than 7. In this croquet club, handicaps range from -2 to +26; the better the player the lower the handicap.
Input

Input will consist of a list of lists containing two items each. Each list contains information for a single potential member. Information consists of an integer for the person's age and an integer for the person's handicap.

Note for F#: The input will be of (int list list) which is a List<List>
Example Input

[[18, 20],[45, 2],[61, 12],[37, 6],[21, 21],[78, 9]]

Output

Output will consist of a list of string values (in Haskell: Open or Senior) stating whether the respective member is to be placed in the senior or open category.
Example Output

["Open", "Open", "Senior", "Open", "Open", "Senior"]

NOTE TO SELF: Was not able to solve this one. Need more familiarity with map, foreach, tunary. Understanding that it is a 2D array is a benefit too.


4) Array Difference

//Note to self: Had help to completely solve all cases.
//Original Algorithm with no help only satisfy certain test cases.

Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, which subtracts one list from another and returns the result.

It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b.

arrayDiff([1,2],[1]) == [2]

If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from the other:

arrayDiff([1,2,2,2,3],[2]) == [1,3]
