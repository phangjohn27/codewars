This was taken off of codewars that I have completed. The goal was to find all uppercases letter in an Array and then return the value of their indexes.

Instructions

Write a function that takes a single string (word) as argument. The function must return an ordered list containing the indexes of all capital letters in the string.

Example

Test.assertSimilar( capitals('CodEWaRs'), [0,3,4,6] );

It covers all cases as well as edge cases too.# practice_from_codewars
